# Fire_Tables
Final Project for Cyber Security Bootcamp at Fullstack Academy

Fire Tables is a graphical user interface (programmed with Python) designed to work with the Linux firewall iptables. 
Since iptables is a command line only application, my project partner and I thought it would be beneficial to build a GUI for ease of use and efficiency. 
Fire Tables allows for multiple firewall rules to be added or removed simultaneously, and without ever having to interact with the command line.
